# sq-32

> **sq-32** - *Named for the fact that a standard checkerboard is 8x8, yet draughts only uses 32 out of the 64 squares.*

sq-32 is a draughts/checkers engine written in Rust. Currently, it also comes packaged with a CLI interface for interacting with the engine directly.

## Roadmap

The program is currently in a very heavily alpha stage, and things are expected to rapidly change as progress is made. Current potential plans for the future include:

- Making a WebAssembly version of the engine, to allow it to be used for online projects more easily.
- Migrate the program to use an established communication protocol, such as Hub-1.
- Split non-essential CLI features (such as pretty board printing) into its own draughts GUI that can interoperate with other engines.
- Make the engine flexible enough to allow analysis of other draughts variants, particularly international draughts.
